description: Get started using und-css in your own projects by installing it as a frontend dependency
---

## Quick Start

For a quick start you first need to install und-css as a dependency to your
project.

```bash
yarn add -D @und-pohlen/und-css
```

```bash
npm install @und-pohlen/und-css --save-dev
```

Presuming you have some kind of SASS transpiler running in your project (e.g.
via webpack or some other task runner) you then simple required the und-css
entry file in your SASS stylesheet.

```scss
@import '@und-pohlen/und-css';
```

## Important Globals

To make live easier and more predictable und-css makes some assumptions about
your HTML markup and sets some opionated styling defaults.

### HTML5 Doctype

und-css requires the HTML5 Doctype. Without it you might experience some weird
rendering issues.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  ...
</html>
```

### Responsive Meta Tag

und-css provides responsive utility classes to make designing for _different
viewports_ easier. To ensure proper renderung and zooming for all devices, you
need to **add the responsive view meta tag** to your `<head>`.

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
```

### Box-sizing

For more logical spacing and size calculations in CSS, und-css switches the
global `box-sizing` value from `content-box` to `border-box`.

On rare occasions you therefore might want to reset this in your custom
component styles building on und-css.

```css
.c-my-component {
  box-sizing: content-box;
}
```
